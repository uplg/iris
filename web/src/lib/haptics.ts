 * — long enough that feedback arriving with the reply would read as lag
 * rather than as acknowledgement. Failures get their own pattern afterwards,
 * which is the one case worth waiting for.
 *
 * `navigator.vibrate` is Android-only; iOS Safari does not implement it, and
 * some embedded webviews throw outright. Every call is therefore guarded:
 * silence is a perfectly good outcome here, an exception is not.
